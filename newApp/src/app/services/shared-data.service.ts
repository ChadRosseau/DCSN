                  The DCSN website is built using the Angular CLI framework and maintains a Firebase database backend. Technicians must be eager to learn and improve, and familiar with working with APIs and external documentation to write custom code. It should be noted that the level of programming skill required for this role exceeds that of the average high-school student.
                  <br><br>
                  Prospective programmers must have basic knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), along experience with at least one object-oriented programming language (<b>JavaScript, TypeScript</b>, Java, C++, C#, Python, etc). Since Angular uses ES6 Javascript and Typescript, previous familiarity with these languages is preferred.`,
